# ![Hello!](https://github.com/Syndamia/Syndamia/blob/master/hello.png?raw=true)

I'm Kamen and currently I'm a programming student. I enjoy everything related to programming and computers: operating systems, embeded systems, desktop applications, networking, game development, etc.

My skills (and interests) are mostly geared towards back-end development, although I have a bit of experience with front-end.

You can learn more about me and my work over at my [website](https://www.syndamia.com).
