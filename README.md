My name is Kamen and currently I'm a programming student.

My skills (and interests) are mostly geared towards back-end development, but I have a bit of experience with front-end.

You can learn more about me and my work over at my [website](https://syndamia.com).

### Caution: I've moved most of my projects over at [https://gitlab.com/Syndamia](https://gitlab.com/Syndamia) and most newer projects will be hosted there too
